The Challenge - One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales â€“ the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.
